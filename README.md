# Drum Kit 🥁

A fun interactive web-application that turns your keyboard (and on-screen buttons) into a virtual drum kit — just press keys or click to play drum sounds!

## 🎯 Project Overview  
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a simple and intuitive browser-based drum kit.  
- Press specified keyboard keys or click buttons on the screen to trigger different drum sounds.  
- Visual feedback (button animation) helps show which drum is being played.  
- Easy to extend: drop in new sound files, add more buttons, map new keys.

## 🧪 Features  
- A set of drum pad buttons labelled with keys (e.g., “w”, “a”, “s”, “d”, “j”, “k”, “l”).  
- Keyboard event listeners that map pressed keys to sound effects.  
- Click event listeners on buttons for mouse interaction.  
- CSS animations / transitions on button press (visual feedback).  
- Responsive basic layout — works on desktop, and usable on touch-devices.
